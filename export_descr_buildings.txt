;== FOURTH AGE: TOTAL WAR - The Dominion of Men  ==
;==================================================

; Coded by Aradan 2008-2014 for The Dominion of Men together with EB and DUB files

; Complete EDB Guide: http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?576124

; NOTES...
; population_loyalty_bonus does not seem to work (negative untested)
; building_factions does not work for recruitment
; Visible BC (building-conditioned) unit recruitment lines cause CTDs. Do not use!
; hidden BC unit recruitment lines & bonus lines incompatible in same building level
; do not allow ships to jump xp between buildings as upgrade to building whilst ship being constructed causes CTD
; City-revolt CTD loop-hole plugged by using unit available only on revolt (slave EDU ownership, faction-based EDB recruitment), RGUs at half start xp

; MEZoRS Build-time Key:
; outland base value = 2-3-4-6 (no bonus); set 5th level to 8 where exists
; fiefdom modifier   = 2-2-3-4 (35% bonus)
; homeland modifier  = 1-1-2-2 (70% bonus)

; NOTES ON NON-INTUITIVE HRS:
; 'rk' refers to all the lands of Gondor, Arnor and Mordor (also in Umbar and Harondor). Adunabar and RK share homelands (that is, Gondor, Arnor and Mordor, designated 'rk').
; rome = id for Minas Anor
; uc = unique city
; dummy = used temporarily to avoid carthaginian-related CTD/KTM having to do with DUB/UI cards
; note that combinations can be and are used to avoid using up more HR slots
